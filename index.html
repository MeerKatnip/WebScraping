    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/shieldprint.JPG" alt="A TXRX face shield 3D print in progress.">
    <p>My name is Amy Roy. I will be joining the Houston cohort that begins on 3/30/2020. I live in Houston, but I love to travel (pre-Coronavirus, of course).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I love gardening</li>
        <li>I love to 3D print</li>
        <li>I love video games</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Currently, I'm spending a lot of my time preparing for bootcamp instruction. Last night, I began 3D printing face shields for healthcare workers in Houston. I hope I can make as many as possible and help fight this health crisis in some way.</p>
